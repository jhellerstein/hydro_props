## DBSP is pretty simple for us to emulate
This assumes we have an Abelian group based on + (commutative, with inverses).
- _Differentiate_ in DBSP takes a cumulative source and produce a delta output. It is implemented as:
```rust
in = mod -> tee();
lastR = R -> defer_tick();
in -> [pos]dR;
lastR -> [neg]dR;
dR = difference() -> mod;
```
More ideally, `difference()` is really `reduce(sum)` on inverse values:
```rust
in = mod -> tee();
lastR = R -> defer_tick();
in -> dR;
lastR -> map(|x| inverse(x)) -> dR;
dR = union() -> reduce(sum) -> mod;
```

- _Integrate_ is essentially
```rust
mod -> reduce(sum) -> mod
```
for the group operator `sum`.

- The key rewriting axioms we want to use are in Proposition 3.2 of the [DBSP arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16684).
With these we can turn a subgraph whose edges are of type Abelian group into a fully differential stream. 

With this it's fairly natural to implement, for example, multiset or set semantics. E.g.
we should be able to do all of datalog/dedalus this way. The DBSP paper gives examples, but it's all
fairly textbook. The trickiest detail is the bilinear operators like join that get rewritten as
$R \times S = dR \times dS \cup dR \times S \cup R \times dS$. We've tested this and it works in Hydroflow today.

## Note: delta vs cumulative is orthogonal to tick vs static
We can have deltas or cumulatives within a tick or across ticks.

## What if we have edges that are not Abelian Groups?
These edges need to work with cumulatives since we cant implement `inverse`. Hence we need to support
flows that are a mix of deltas and cumulatives in the runtime.

## Current concerns
- To save work, can we passing cumulatives by reference rather than by value?
- Our current scheduling sometimes wants to reference unchanged upstream cumulatives for binary ops
  with `static` semantics implemented via `persist` ops.
  Example in current
  (non-DBSP-emulating) hydroflow is
  ```rust
   left = R -> persist() -> tee();
   right = S -> persist() -> tee();
   left -> ... <otherstuff>;
   right -> ... <moreotherstuff>;

   left -> [0]join::<'tick>;
   right -> filter(...) -> [1]join;
   ```
  The interesting bit is the last line -- when we get a new `left` tuple, we need to join against all the
  `right` tuples so we want to "replay" the `persist()` on `S` (the second line).

  Questions:
  1. is this even worth supporting, or does a `persist()` need to be at the input to the join in all cases?
      - If we require/inject a `persist` for any such join, would redundant `persist`s be easy to "rewrite away"
      - What are the rewriting rules for `persist` -- i.e. what does it commute with?
  2. for streams that are Abelian groups, does the bilinear delta rewrite above make this problem go away?
  3. How would we rethink this example in terms of cumulative and delta edge types?
